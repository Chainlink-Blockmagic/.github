## Chainlink BlockMagic Hackathon

In the rapidly evolving world of blockchain and cryptocurrency, we believe that the potential for growth and innovation is limitless. However, the volatility and risk of scams have created a barrier to mass adoption, hindering the widespread acceptance of cryptoassets.

At Blockshield, we're committed to bridging this gap by harnessing the power of insurance and banking expertise to create innovative solutions that reduce these risks. Our goal is to empower individuals and institutions to confidently invest in the crypto-asset market, knowing that their assets are protected and have the proper transparency assured.

Our project, Blockshield, is designed to provide peace of mind for RWA crypto-asset holders, safeguarding their investments against the credit risk related to default events on its debt obligations, and ensuring the integrity of the market. By leveraging blockchain technology and our expertise in insurance and banking, we want to create a safer and more reliable environment for the growth of the RWA cryptoasset ecosystem.
